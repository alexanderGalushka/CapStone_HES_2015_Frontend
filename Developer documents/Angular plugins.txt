Smart Table
===========================

One of important plugins, we use in application, is  that facilitates all our

data grids. It has several important features:

• pure Angular solution - declarative way

• lightweight - 4K

• easy to configure and customize

• modular and extensible

The Smart Table plugin provides functionality out of box:

• full control of data and cell formats

• Sort data is built in, it is declarative, and you may specify function for sort

• Search can be done globally, by column, or through predicates

• It has select and multiselect row option

• Built in pagination on client side

• It can sync display data with underlying base data operated through remote calls.

• Pipe/ajax plugin allows us to override basic display table operation and call server

instead.

• We can add your own plugin to extend its functionality
==========================

AngularStrap
===========================

Another plugin we use through whole application is AngularStrap that is based on

Bootstrap CSS framework. Although, Bootstrap framework provides similar javascript

modules we decided to use AngularStrap module for following reasons:

• pure Angular solution - declarative way

• set of native directives that enables seamless integration of Bootstrap

• no external dependency except the Bootstrap CSS style
