Smart Table     smart-table in app.js
===========================

One of important plugins, we use in application, is  that facilitates all our

data grids. It has several important features:

• pure Angular solution - declarative way

• lightweight - 4K

• easy to configure and customize

• modular and extensible

The Smart Table plugin provides functionality out of box:

• full control of data and cell formats

• Sort data is built in, it is declarative, and you may specify function for sort

• Search can be done globally, by column, or through predicates

• It has select and multiselect row option

• Built in pagination on client side

• It can sync display data with underlying base data operated through remote calls.

• Pipe/ajax plugin allows us to override basic display table operation and call server

instead.

• We can add your own plugin to extend its functionality
==========================

AngularStrap      mgcrea.ngStrap in app.js
===========================

Another plugin we use through whole application is AngularStrap that is based on

Bootstrap CSS framework. Although, Bootstrap framework provides similar javascript

modules we decided to use AngularStrap module for following reasons:

• pure Angular solution - declarative way

• set of native directives that enables seamless integration of Bootstrap

• no external dependency except the Bootstrap CSS style

===========================

AngularJS directive slider control - ngSlider in app.js
===========================
Slider directive implementation for AngularJS, without jQuery dependencies

===========================

ngFileUpload in app.js
===========================
Lightweight Angular JS directive to upload files.

Features:
Supports upload progress, cancel/abort upload while in progress, File drag and drop (html5), Directory drag and drop (webkit), CORS, PUT(html5)/POST methods, validation of file type and size, show preview of selected images/audio/videos.
Cross browser file upload and FileReader (HTML5 and non-HTML5) with Flash polyfill FileAPI. Allows client side validation/modification before uploading the file
Direct upload to db services CouchDB, imgur, etc... with file's content type using Upload.http(). This enables progress event for angular http POST/PUT requests.
Seperate shim file, FileAPI files are loaded on demand for non-HTML5 code meaning no extra load/code if you just need HTML5 support.
Lightweight using regular $http to upload (with shim for non-HTML5 browsers) so all angular $http features are available
